# Face-Emotion-Detection-System
The Face Emotion Detection system employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract physiological signals and make accurate predictions. By scanning a person's image through a camera, the system correlates the data with a training dataset, enabling it to predict the individual's emotional state with precision, offering valuable insights into the user's emotional well-being in real-time scenarios.
